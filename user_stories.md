As any user of the site I want to see the root page so that I can know there is actually a site there.

  - User visits root page
  - It has content about selling and buying jewelry

As an unregistered user I should be able to register for the site so that I can actually use it.

  - User clicks sign up link
  - User enters email address, password, other info to register
  - User is then able to log in

As a registered user I want to list my jewelry on the site so that other people can buy it.

  - User clicks "add jewelry"
  - enters type of jewelry, hours worked on it, the cost of its materials
  - it gets added to the user's jewelries

As a user who has previously entered jewelries I should be able to see a list of what I've entered so that I can know how much I have.

  - User clicks "view my jewelries"
  - All the previously entered pieces should be in the list
  - they should show the type, materials cost, hours worked, and a price calculated from the hours worked and materials

As a user with money to spend I should be able to see the jewelries for sale so that I can actually spend my money.

  - User clicks "view jewelries for sale"
  - all the jewelries entered by other users should show up here

As someone who is buying jewelry I (and the seller) should get a confirmation email so that I have a reminder of what I bought.

  - User clicks a "buy this" link on the list of jewelries for sale
  - the piece is removed from the public list
  - both the buyer and seller get emails saying as such
